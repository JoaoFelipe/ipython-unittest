IPython-Unittest
==========

This extension provides three cell magics for IPython/Jupyter

First magic is `%%unittest_main`. This magic runs testcases defined in a cell

```python
%%unittest_main
class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_1_plus_1_equals_2(self):
        sum = 1 + 1
        self.assertEqual(sum, 2)
	
    def test_2_plus_2_equals_4(self):
        self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)
```

Second magic is `%%unittest_testcase`. This magic creates a testcase with
functions defined in the cell and execute it.

```python
%%unittest_testcase
def test_1_plus_1_equals_2(self):
    sum = 1 + 1
    self.assertEqual(sum, 2)

def test_2_plus_2_equals_4(self):
    self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)
```

Third magic is `%%unittest`. This magic converts Python assert into
unittest functions.

```python
%%unittest
"1 plus 1 equals 2"
sum = 1 + 1
assert sum == 2
"2 plus 2 equals 4"
assert 2 + 2 == 4
```

By default, docstring in this magic will separate unittest methods.
However, if docstrings are not provided, the magic will create a method for
for each assert.

These magics support optional arguments:
```
-c (--color):      change logo color to indicate whether or not the tests
                   have passed
-p (--previous) P: set cursor to P cells before (default: -1 = next cell)
-s (--stream) S:   set test output stream (default: 'sys.stdout')
-t (--testcase) T: define TestCase name.
                   Valid for '%%unittest' and '%%unittest_testcase'
-u (--unparse):    print cell source code after transformations.
```
