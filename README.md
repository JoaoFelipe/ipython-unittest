IPython-Unittest
==========

This extension provides testing support to IPython through cell magics. Currently, we have three magics that transforms the cell code and executes unittest: `%%unittest_main`, `%%unittest_testcase` and `%%unittest`; one magic to run external tests: `%%external`; and one associated magic to write external files with syntax highlight: `%%write {mode}`

Additionally, it includes actions to Jupyter toolbar with a timer and a people log to support coding dojo sessions. These actions can be either loaded on demand or installed as a nbextension

How to Install
----

```pip install ipython_unittest```

To load the extension, please run:
```python
%load_ext ipython_unittest
```

Alternatively, to load the extension and the coding dojo toolbar, please run:
```python
%load_ext ipython_unittest.dojo
```

The coding dojo toolbar can be installed as a stand-alone nbextension as well:
```
jupyter nbextension install --py ipython_unittest --user
jupyter nbextension enable --py ipython_unittest --user
```


Cell Magics
----

The first magic is `%%unittest_main`. This magic runs testcases defined in a cell

```python
%%unittest_main
class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_1_plus_1_equals_2(self):
        sum = 1 + 1
        self.assertEqual(sum, 2)

    def test_2_plus_2_equals_4(self):
        self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)
```

The second magic is `%%unittest_testcase`. This magic creates a testcase with
functions defined in the cell and execute it.

```python
%%unittest_testcase
def test_1_plus_1_equals_2(self):
    sum = 1 + 1
    self.assertEqual(sum, 2)

def test_2_plus_2_equals_4(self):
    self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)
```

The third magic is `%%unittest`. This magic converts Python assert into
unittest functions.

```python
%%unittest
"1 plus 1 equals 2"
sum = 1 + 1
assert sum == 2
"2 plus 2 equals 4"
assert 2 + 2 == 4
```

By default, docstring in this magic will separate unittest methods.
However, if docstrings are not provided, the magic will create a method for
for each assert.

These magics support optional arguments:
```
-c (--color):      change logo color to indicate whether or not the tests
                   have passed
-p (--previous) P: set cursor to P cells before (default: -1 = next cell)
-s (--stream) S:   set test output stream (default: 'sys.stdout')
-t (--testcase) T: define TestCase name.
                   Valid for '%%unittest' and '%%unittest_testcase'
-u (--unparse):    print cell source code after transformations.
```

The fourth magic is `%%external`. This magic runs external system commands and check their exit codes. This way, it is possible to run tests from other languages:
```python
%%external -p 1
mocha test.js
```

The `%external` magic supports the arguments `--color` and `--previous` described before.


Finally, since it is possible to run external commands, we included an extra magic, `%%write` to write files and keep the syntax highlight.
This magic receives a CodeMirror mode as first argument and the remaining arguments are redirected to IPython's `%%writefile`

Note that it will start highlighting after the first execution.

```javascript
%%write javascript test.js
var assert = require('assert');
describe('Array', function() {
  describe('#indexOf()', function() {
    it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function() {
      assert.equal(-1, [1,2,3].indexOf(4));
    });
  });
});
```
